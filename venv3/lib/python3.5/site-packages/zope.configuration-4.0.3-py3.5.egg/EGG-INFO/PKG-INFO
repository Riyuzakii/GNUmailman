Description: zope.configuration README
        =========================
        
        The zope configuration system provides an extensible system for
        supporting various kinds of configurations.
        
        It is based on the idea of configuration directives. Users of the
        configuration system provide configuration directives in some
        language that express configuration choices. The intent is that the
        language be pluggable.  An XML language is provided by default.
        
        Please see http://docs.zope.org/zope.configuration/ for the documentation.

          https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.configuration/+bug/1025390
        
        4.0.0 (2012-05-16)
        ------------------
        
        - 100% unit test coverage.
        
        - Automated build of Sphinx HTML docs and running doctest snippets via tox.
        
        - Dropped hard testing dependency on ``zope.testing``.
        
        - Added explicit support for PyPy.
        
        - Added explicit support for Python 3.2.
        
        - Dropped explicit support for Python 2.4 / 2.5.
        
        - Added support for continuous integration using ``tox`` and ``jenkins``.
        
        - Added ``Sphinx`` documentation.
        
        - Added ``setup.py docs`` alias (installs ``Sphinx`` and dependencies).
        
        - Added ``setup.py dev`` alias (runs ``setup.py develop`` plus installs
          ``nose`` and ``coverage``).
        
        3.8.1 (2012-05-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed Python 2.4 backwards incompat (itemgetter used with multiple args);
          Python 2.4 now works (at least if you use zope.schema == 3.8.1).
          This is the last release which will support Python 2.4 or 2.5.
        
        3.8.0 (2011-12-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Action structures changed from tuples to dictionaries to allow for action
          structure extensibility (merged chrism-dictactions branch).
        
        3.7.4 (2011-04-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Test fixes for Windows.
        
        3.7.3 (2011-03-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Correctly locate packages with a __path__ attribute but no
          __file__ attribute (such as namespace packages installed with setup.py
          install --single-version-externally-managed).
        
        - Allow "info" and "includepath" to be passed optionally to context.action.
        
        3.7.2 (2010-04-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Prefer the standard libraries doctest module over zope.testing.doctest.
        
        3.7.1 (2010-01-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Jython support: use ``__builtin__`` module import rather than assuming
          ``__builtins__`` is available.
        
        - Jython support: deal with the fact that the Jython SAX parser
          returns attribute sets that have an empty string indicating no
          namespace instead of ``None``.
        
        - Allow ``setup.py test`` to run at least a subset of the tests that
          would be run when using the zope testrunner: ``setup.py test`` runs
          53 tests, while ``bin/test`` runs 156.
        
        3.7.0 (2009-12-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Adjust testing output to newer zope.schema.
        
        - Prefer zope.testing.doctest over doctestunit.
        
        3.6.0 (2009-04-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed dependency of `zope.deprecation` package.
        
        - Don't suppress deprecation warnings any more in 'zope.configuration'
          package level. This makes it more likely other packages will generate
          deprecation warnings now, which will allow us to remove more
          outdated ones.
        
        - Don't fail when zope.testing is not installed.
        
        - Added missing ``processFile`` method to ``IConfigurationContext``.
          It is already implemented in the mix-in class,
          ``zope.configuration.config.ConfigurationContext``, and used by
          implementations of ``include`` and ``exclude`` directives.
        
        3.5.0 (2009-02-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Added the ``exclude`` directive to standard directives. It was
          previously available via ``zc.configuration`` package and now it's
          merged into ``zope.configuration``.
        
        - Changed package's mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org,
          change "cheeseshop" to "pypi" in the package's url.
        
        3.4.1 (2008-12-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Use built-in 'set' type, rather than importin the 'sets' module,
          which is deprecated in Python 2.6.
        
        - Added support to bootstrap on Jython.
        
        3.4.0 (2007-10-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Initial release as a standalone package.
        
        Before 3.4.0
        ------------
