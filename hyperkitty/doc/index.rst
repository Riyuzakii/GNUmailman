=====================================================
HyperKitty, the next-generation mailing-list archiver
=====================================================

HyperKitty is a Django-based application providing a web interface to access
GNU Mailman v3 archives, and interact with the lists.

The project page is https://gitlab.com/mailman/hyperkitty.

There is a `demo server`_ available, but it's also a development server, so it
may be broken at the time you access it. It's usually OK though.

.. _demo server: https://lists.stg.fedoraproject.org/archives/

Why HyperKitty?
===============

Mailman is in need for replacement of its default Pipermail archiver. It is
over 10 years old, users' expectations have changed and their requirements are
more sophisticated than the current archiver can deliver on. Mailman3 is the
currently under active development and it offers a pluggable architecture where
multiple archivers can be plugged to the core without too much pain.

Some of drawbacks of Pipermail :

- It does not support stable URLs.
- It has scalability issues (it was not suitable for organizations working with
  hundred of thousand of messages per day, e.g, Launchpad)
- The web interface is dated and does not output standards-compliant HTML nor
  does it take advantage of new technologies such as AJAX.

The HyperKitty archiver addresses most of the drawbacks of Pipermail.
