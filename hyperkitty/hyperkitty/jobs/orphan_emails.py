"""
Find the parents of orphan emails.

When an email has an in-reply-to header pointing to no known email, it
is set to start a new thread. This job runs later on and tries to find the
missing email in the database, in case it was added in the meantime.

This can happen if HK receives the reply before the original message (when a
mail server in the chain has an issue, or in case of greylisting for example).
