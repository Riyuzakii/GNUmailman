Subject: [Fedora-packaging] RPM macros
Message-ID: <4FFC1228.3060409@redhat.com>

Hi,

I noticed that in revised haskell guidelines [1], there is mentioned the 
ghc-rpm-macros package, which provides macros.ghc file, which in turns 
provides some useful macros for packaging of Haskell packages. In Ruby, 
we provide similar macro files in ruby-devel and rubygems-devel 
subpackages respectively. Perl has their macros directly in the rpm 
package itself.

This seems to be a bit inconsistent to me. So my question is: shouldn't 
we standardize some best practices with regards of RPM macros? For 
example for Ruby, we placed the macros into -devel subpackages, because 
we believe that it is just development dependency. Any opinions?
